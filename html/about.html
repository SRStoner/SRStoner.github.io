            <h1>Current Day</h1> 
            <p> 
                Happily just completed my final year of college at Indiana University Southeast (IUS), Go Grenaiders!  
                I went for a degree in Computer Science(Information Systems) and have found that I enjoy working with front-end 
                developement, so here I am.  I will try and continue updating this little personal website throught the coming years!  
                Thanks to anyone who happens to  check out my page.

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>
                On my free time I enjoy spending time with friends/family, playing video games, watching NBA, and 
                learning more about web development!  Currently enjoying working with node.js and express. When it comes to 
                games, my go to is definately League of Legends.  Been playing since 2013 and still greatly enjoy the game 
                with friends on a weekly basis.  You'll probably catch me talking about my fav nba teams which are the Jazz 
                and Pacers.  Dame and Ja my guys though!

            <h1>Languages/Software</h1>
            <p>
                Throughout my time at IUS, I have got some experience working with many different languages/software. 
                Some of them include Java, C++, C#, F#, Python, Assembly, HTML, CSS, JS, MongoDB, and SQL.  While I certainly 
                am not close to mastering any of these languages, I do atleast have some experience working with them.

            <h1> Experience</h1>
            <p>
                Im currently working part-time as an IT consultant on campus at IUS.  I figured this could be a good little starting point 
                for myself. At the time of writing this, I'm about to start my final semester of college.  After I plan on obtaining 
                a+ certification and maybe security+ aswell.  I intend to do some sort of IT work right after exiting this semester or 
                even some front-end developement and am quite excited to see where the future takes me.

            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>
                Projects i've worked on include a little resturant website 
                using Springbooot, a kotlin mobile developement tour guide app about France,and  also a networked platformer 
                game using unity and photon pun for the server capabilities.  Currently working on a voice recognition feature
                for a Churchill Solitaire card game which would allow the user to play purely with voice. I do plan on uploading these to
                my Github profile soon which will display some of these projects mentioned.
