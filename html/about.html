            <h1>Current Day</h1> 
            <p> 
                Just finished my senior year of college at Indiana University Southeast (IUS), Go Grenaiders!  
                Im going for a degree in<br> Computer Information Systems (CIS)  and have found that I enjoy working with front-end 
                developement, so here I am.  Thanks<br> to anyone who happens to  check out my page. <br>  
                <hr>
            </p>

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>
                On my free time I enjoy spending time with friends/family, playing video games, watching NBA, and 
                learning more about web <br>development! When it comes to games, my go to is definately League of Legends.
                Been playing since 2013 and still greatly enjoy<br> the game with friends on a weekly basis.  You'll probably 
                catch me talking about my fav nba teams which are the Jazz and Pacers.  <br>Dame and Ja my guys though!<br>

            <h1>Languages/Software</h1>
            <p>
                Throughout my time at IUS, I have got some experience working with many different languages/software. 
                Some of them include <br>Java, C++, C#, F#, Python, Assembly, HTML, CSS, JS, MongoDB, and SQL.  While I certainly 
                am not close to mastering any of <br>these languages, I do atleast have some experience working with them. <br>

            <h1> Experience</h1>
            <p>
                Im currently working part-time as an IT consultant on campus at IUS.  I figured this could be a good little starting point 
                for myself. <br>At the time of writing this, I'm about to start my final semester of college.  After I plan on obtaining 
                a+ certification and maybe <br>security+ aswell.  I intend to do some sort of IT work right after exiting this semester or 
                even some front-end developement and am <br>quite excited to see where the future takes me. <br>

            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>
                Projects i've worked on include a little resturant website 
                using Springbooot, a kotlin mobile developement tour guide app about <br>France,and  also a networked platformer 
                game using unity and photon pun for the server capabilities.  Currently working on a voice <br>recognition feature
                for a Churchill Solitaire card game which would allow the user to play purely with voice. I do plan on uploading<br> these to
                my Github profile soon which will display some of these projects mentioned.<br>
